# A collection of HPC dwarf reference implementations

This is a collection of C implementations for the HPC dwarfs algorithmic classes as initially proposed by the report [The Landscape of Parallel Computing Research: A
View from Berkeley](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2006/EECS-2006-183.pdf).

Implemented dwarfs:

- Sparse Linear Algebra: [SparseBench](https://github.com/HPC-Dwarfs/SparseBench)
- N-Body Methods: [MD-Bench](https://github.com/HPC-Dwarfs/MD-Bench)
- Structured Grids: [NuSif-Solver](https://github.com/HPC-Dwarfs/NuSiF-Solver)

Benchmarks:
- Memory hierarchy bandwidth: [TheBandwidthBenchmark](https://github.com/HPC-Dwarfs/TheBandwidthBenchmark)

This is an effort by [NHR@FAU](https://nhr.fau.de)
