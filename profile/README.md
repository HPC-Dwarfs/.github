# A collection of algorithmic classes reference implementations

This is a collection of C implementations for the HPC dwarfs algorithmic classes as initially proposed by the report [The Landscape of Parallel Computing Research: A
View from Berkeley](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2006/EECS-2006-183.pdf).

Implemented dwarfs:

- Sparse Linear Algebra: [SparseBench](https://github.com/HPC-Dwarfs/SparseBench)
- N-Body Methods: [MD-Bench]()
- Structured Grids: [NuSif-Solver](https://github.com/HPC-Dwarfs/NuSiF-Solver)

Additional basic benchmarks:
- Memory hierarchy bandwidth: [TheBandwidthBenchmark]()
